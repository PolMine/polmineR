<div id="purpose" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#purpose" class="anchor"></a>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of the package <em>polmineR</em> is to offer a toolset for the interactive analysis of corpora using R. Apart from performance and usability, key considerations for developing the package are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To provide a library with standard tasks such as concordances/keyword-in-context, cooccurrence statistics, feature extraction, or preparation of term-document-matrics.</p></li>
<li><p>To keep the original text accessible and to offer a seamless integration of qualitative and quantitative steps in corpus analysis that facilitates validation.</p></li>
<li><p>To make the creation and analysis of subcorpora (‘partitions’) as easy as possible. A particular strength of the package is to support research on synchronic and diachronic change of language use.</p></li>
<li><p>To offer performance for users with a standard infrastructure. The package is developed based on the idea of a three-tier software design. Corpus data are managed and indexed using the <a href="http://cwb.sourceforge.net/">Corpus Workbench (CWB)</a>, which serves as a backend.</p></li>
<li><p>To support sharing consolidated and documented data, following the ideas of reproducible research.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>polmineR</em> package supplements R packages that are already widely used for text mining. The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=NaturalLanguageProcessing">CRAN NLP task view</a> is a good place to learn about relevant packages. The <em>polmineR</em> package is intended to be an interface between the <a href="http://cwb.sourceforge.net/">Corpus Workbench (CWB)</a>, an efficient system for storing and querying large corpora, and existing packages for text mining and text statistics.</p>
<p>Apart from the speed of text processing, the Corpus Query Processor (CQP) and the <a href="http://cwb.sourceforge.net/files/CQP_Tutorial.pdf">CQP syntax</a> provide a powerful and widely used syntax to query corpora. This is not an unique idea. Using a combination of R and the CWB implies a software architecture you will also find in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/txm/">TXM project</a>, or with <a href="http://cwb.sourceforge.net/cqpweb.php">CQPweb</a>. The <em>polmineR</em> package offers a library with the grammer of corpus analysis below a graphical user interface (GUI). It is a toolset to perform simple tasts efficiently as well as to implement complex workflows.</p>
<p>Advanced users will benefit from acquiring a good understanding of the Corpus Workbench. The <a href="http://cwb.sourceforge.net/files/CWB_Encoding_Tutorial.pdf">Corpus Encoding Tutorial</a> is an authoritative text for that. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rcqp/">The vignette of the rcqp package</a>, albeit archived, includes an excellent explanation of the CWB data-model. The inferface used now to use CWB/CQP functionality is the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppCWB">RcppCWB package</a>.</p>
<p>A basic issue to understand is the difference between <em>s</em>- and <em>p</em>-attributes. The CWB distinguishes structural attributes (s-attributes) that will contain the metainformation that can be used to generate subcorpora/partitions, and positional attributes (p-attributes). Typically, the p-attributes will be ‘word’, ‘pos’ (for part-of-speech) and ‘lemma’ (for the lemmatized word form).</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#getting-started" class="anchor"></a>Getting started</h2>
<p>CRAN releases of <em>polmineR</em> can be installed with the usual call of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages()</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span>(<span class="st">"polmineR"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Binaries are available for Windows, and everything should work out of the box. On macOS and Linux, system requirements need to be fulfilled. The annex of the vignette includes a detailed explanation how to install <em>polmineR</em> on macOS, and Linux.</p>
<div id="loading-polminer" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#loading-polminer" class="anchor"></a>Loading polmineR</h3>
<p>The <em>polmineR</em> package is loaded just like any other package.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="no">polmineR</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Upon loading the package, the package version is reported. As <em>polmineR</em> is under active development, please check whether a more recent version is available at CRAN. Development versions are available at GitHub.</p>
<p>In addition, you will see an information on the <em>session registry</em>, which needs some further explanation.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-session-registry-directory" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-session-registry-directory" class="anchor"></a>The session registry directory</h3>
<p>Indexed corpus data may be stored at different locations on your machine. CWB users will usually have a data directory with subdirectories for every single corpus. But corpus data may also reside within R packages, or anywhere else.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to move indexed corpora to one single location. The only recommendation is to have them on a device that can be accessed sufficiently fast. Corpora are not fully loaded into memory, but information is retrieved from disk on a ‘on demand’-basis. Thus, storing corpus data on a SSD may be faster than a hard drive.</p>
<p>The CWB will look up information on the corpora in a directory called <em>registry</em> that is defined by the environment variable CORPUS_REGISTRY. Starting with version v0.7.9, the <em>polmineR</em> package creates a temporary registry directory in the temporary session directory. To get the path of the session registry directory, call <code><a href="../reference/registry.html">registry()</a></code>. The output is the session registry you have seen when loading <em>polmineR</em>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/registry.html">registry</a></span>()</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "/private/var/folders/m_/431fjnbs1t32_62d35wvs7pr0000gp/T/RtmpB9Mo1Q/polmineR_registry"</code></pre>
<p>The session registry directory combines the registry files describing the corpora <em>polmineR</em> knows about. Upon loading <em>polmineR</em>, the files in the registry directory defined by the environment variable CORPUS_REGISTRY are copied to the session registry directory. To see whether the environment variable CORPUS_REGISTRY is set, use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.getenv.html">Sys.getenv()</a></code>-function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.getenv.html">Sys.getenv</a></span>(<span class="st">"CORPUS_REGISTRY"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>See the annex for an explanation how to set the CORPUS_REGISTRY environment variable for the current R session, or permanently.</p>
<div id="using-and-installing-packaged-corpora" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#using-and-installing-packaged-corpora" class="anchor"></a>Using and installing packaged corpora</h4>
<p>If you want to use a corpus wrapped into a R data package, call <code><a href="../reference/use.html">use()</a></code> with the name of the R package. The function will add the registry files describing the corpora in the package to the session registry directory introduced before.</p>
<p>In the followings examples, the REUTERS corpus included in the <em>polmineR</em> package will be used for demonstration purposes. It is a sample of Reuters articles that is included in the tm package (cp. <a href="http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/" class="uri">http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/</a>), and may already be known to some R users.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/use.html">use</a></span>(<span class="st">"polmineR"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>If you want to use corpora, you can download the EuroParl and the GermaParl data packages from a CRAN-like repository hosted by the PolMine Project.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span>(<span class="st">"europarl.en"</span>, <span class="kw">repo</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="st">"http://polmine.sowi.uni-due.de/packages"</span>)

<p>We some advantages to use R data packages for shipping corpora. Data packages with corpora have a version number which may be important for reproducing results, they can include a vignette documenting the data, and functions to perform specialized tasks.</p>

<a href="#checking-that-corpora-are-available" class="anchor"></a>Checking that corpora are available</h4>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/corpus-class.html">corpus()</a></code>-method can be used to check which corpora are described in the registry and accessible. The REUTERS corpus in our case (note that the names of CWB corpora are always written upper case). In addition to the English REUTERS corpus, a small subset of the GermaParl corpus (“GERMAPARLMINI”) is included in the <em>polmineR</em> package.</p>

<div id="session-settings" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#session-settings" class="anchor"></a>Session settings</h4>
<p>Many methods in the <em>polmineR</em> package use default settings that are set in the general options settings. Following a convention, settings relevant for the <em>polmineR</em> package simplystart with ‘polmineR.’ Inspect the settings as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/options.html">options</a></span>()[<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/grep.html">grep</a></span>(<span class="st">"polmineR"</span>, <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/names.html">names</a></span>(<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/options.html">options</a></span>()))]</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Several methods (such as kwic, or cooccurrences) will use these settings, if no explicit other value is provided. You can see this in the usage section of help pages (<code><a href="../reference/kwic.html">?kwic</a></code>, for instance). To change settings, this is how.</p>

<p>Core analytical tasks are implemented as methods (S4 class system), i.e. the bevaviour of the methods changes depending on the object that is supplied. Almost all methods can be applied to corpora (indicated by a length-one character vector) as well as partitions (subcorpora). As a quick start, methods applied to corpora are explained first.</p>

<a href="#working-with-subcorpora---partitions" class="anchor"></a>Working with subcorpora - partitions</h2>
<p>Working with partitions (i.e. subcorpora) based on s-attributes is an important feature of the ‘polmineR’ package. So if we want to work with the articles in the REUTERS corpus related to Kuaweit in 2006:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">kuwait</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/partition.html">partition</a></span>(<span class="st">"REUTERS"</span>, <span class="kw">places</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="st">"kuwait"</span>, <span class="kw">regex</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="fl">TRUE</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>To get some basic information about the partition that has been set up, the ‘show’-method can be used. It is also called when you simply type the name of the partition object.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">kuwait</span></pre></body></html></div>

<p>To evaluate s-attributes, regular expressions can be used.</p>

<p>If you work with a flat XML structure, the order of the provided s-attributes may be relevant for speeding up the set up of the partition. For a nested XML, it is important that with the order, you move from ancestors to childs. For further information, see the documentation of the partition-function.</p>

<p>For many applications, term-document matrices are the point of departure. The tm class TermDocumentMatrix serves as an input to several R packages implementing advanced text mining techniques. Obtaining this input from a corpus imported to the CWB will usually involve setting up a partitionBundle and then applying a method to get the matrix.</p>

<p>A key consideration of the polmineR package is to offer tools for combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to text analysis. Use the <code><a href="../reference/html-method.html">html()</a></code>-method, or the <code><a href="../reference/read-method.html">read()</a></code>-method to return to the full text. In this example, we define a maximum height for the output, which is useful when including full text output in a Rmarkdown document.</p>

<p>The following instructions for Mac users assume that R is installed on your system. Binaries are available from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">Homepage of the R Project</a>. An installation of RStudio is highly recommended. Get the Open Source License version of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">RStudio Desktop</a>.</p>
<div id="installing-rcppcwb" class="section level5">
<h5 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#installing-rcppcwb" class="anchor"></a>Installing RcppCWB</h5>
<p>To install polmineR on macOS, you first need to install RcppCWB.</p>
<p>First, you will need an installation of Xcode, which you can get it via the Mac App Store. You will also need the Command Line Tools for Xcode. It can be installed from a terminal with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb54-1" title="1"><span class="ex">xcode-select</span> --install</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Please make sure that you agree to the license.</p>
<p>Second, an installation of XQuartz is required, it can be obtained from <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">www.xquartz.org</a>.</p>
<p>Third, to compile the C code in the RcppCWB package, there are system requirements that need to be fulfilled. Using a package manager makes things considerably easier. We recommend using ‘Homebrew’. To install Homebrew, follow the instructions on the <a href="https://brew.sh/index_de.html">Homebrew Homepage</a>. The following commands then need to be executed from a terminal window. They will install the dependencies that the RcppCWB package relies on:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-1" title="1"><span class="ex">brew</span> -v install pkg-config</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-2" title="2"><span class="ex">brew</span> -v install glib --universal</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-3" title="3"><span class="ex">brew</span> -v install pcre --universal</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-4" title="4"><span class="ex">brew</span> -v install readline</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Fourth, install RcppCWB.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span>(<span class="st">"RcppCWB"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Now everything is ready to install polmineR.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span>(<span class="st">"polmineR"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>A quick check that polmineR is installed correctly is to load the library, and to check which corpora are available.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="no">polmineR</span>)

<p>The development version of <em>polmineR</em> can be installed using devtools:</p>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-2" title="2"><span class="fu">sudo</span> apt-get install libxml2-dev</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb62-3" title="3"><span class="fu">sudo</span> apt-get install libprotobuf-dev</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The system requirements will now be fulfilled. From R, install dependencies for rcqp/polmineR first, and then rcqp and polmineR.</p>

<p>The environment variable “CORPUS_REGISTRY” can be set as follows in R:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb66"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.setenv.html">Sys.setenv</a></span>(<span class="kw">CORPUS_REGISTRY</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="st">"C:/PATH/TO/YOUR/REGISTRY"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>To set the environment variable CORPUS_REGISTRY permanently, see the instructions R offer how to find the file ‘.Renviron’ or ‘.Renviron.site’ when calling the help for the startup process(<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Startup.html">?Startup</a></code>).</p>
